# tcc-compiler
- This repository hosts a comprehensive learning project focused on compiler development, with the ultimate goal of creating a compiler akin to that of the C++ language. 
- The project encompasses manual development of both the lexical analyzer and the syntax parser, intentionally eschewing automated tools such as flex and bison in favor of a hands-on approach to understanding the intricacies of compiler construction. 
- The initiative plans to interface with LLVM to generate executable programs, marking a significant milestone in the project's progression. Initially, the project aims to implement a subset of the C language, providing a solid foundation upon which to incrementally expand the syntax rules. 
- This ambitious educational venture not only aims to deepen understanding of compiler mechanics but also to cultivate comprehensive skills in compiler design and implementation.
